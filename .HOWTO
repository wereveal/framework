1.  rm -Rf .git
    Do not create a new branch of the framework repository and push it to the
    ritcframework remote repository. Always make a new project/new remote repo 
    Best practice is to create a new project in the app/src/Namespace area
2.  clone Library from git
    1. cd app/src/Ritc
    2. git clone ssh://wer@wereveal.com/srv/git/ritclibrary Library
    3. clone any other Ritc app needed
    4. cd ../../../
3.  composer.phar install
4.  cd app/config
    1. php create_classmap.php
    2. create database and assign user to it 
    2. php install.php -a AppName -n Namespace -h db_host -t db_type -d db_name -u db_user -p db_pass -f db_prefix
7.  cd ../../
8.  Get to work (including creating a new git project).

Remember: create_classmap.php needs to be run anytime a new class file is added to the app.
