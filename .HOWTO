# Main HowTo
1. rm -Rf .git
   Do not create a new branch of the framework repository and push it to the
   ritcframework remote repository. Always make a new project/new remote repo 
   Best practice is to create a new project in the app/src/Namespace area
   All paths are from the root of the project hereby called /.
2. Create database and assign user to it 
3. clone Library from git
    1. move to app/src/Ritc
    2. git clone ssh://wer@wereveal.com/srv/git/ritclibrary Library
    3. clone any other Ritc app needed
    4. Move to project root
4. composer.phar install
5. bower install
6. Move to /app/config/install and modify install_config.php or copy to a new file and modify that file. 
	1. Be sure to specify new file when running install.php.
	2. Database and user created should be specified in file.
	3. New App name and Root Namespace need to be specified. It will create some blank directories for you.
7.  Move to /bin
    php install.php (config.file)
8.  Move to /src/namespace/appname where namespace and appname are what you specified in the config file before install.
9.  Get to work on your new project.
